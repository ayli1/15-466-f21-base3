# A Canary's Warning

Author: Anna Li

Design: Don't you wanna get rich? Come mine some emeralds! Just make sure not to stay in the mine too long after the canary stops singing...

How To Play:

Move the miner into and around the mine shaft using the WASD keys. Once you get to an emerald, whack at it repeatedly with the space bar until that gem pops out! Some gems are worth more than others, but you won't know until it's out... And, of course, heed the canary's warning -- you have only a little time to get out of the mine after it stops singing. Go, go, go!
